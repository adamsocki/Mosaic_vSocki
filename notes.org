TODO: figure out whats up with glTexParameter and why its necessary
      Frame buffers

We should have a text region on the right, and the graph on the left, when you select certain things it'll pop up some text on the right.


I want to start drawing passing in colors so we'll build up buffers, copy the data, and then draw with color as a vertex attrib


Create a library for interactive math experiments

Needs to require very little programming knowledge (but could be good testing ground for basic logic/control flow)

Puzzle game: could be make the dot product < 0. Make it 0, etc. Make this face a diffrent way from this object (using dot product). 
Move vectors into different spaces, like transforming the direction into normalized space. 
Is this thing's coordinates in world or local space? 

Set t value so the point reaches the destination. Write a calculation for t so that it arrives in 2 seconds
Change the values of the easing function so the curves match


Lerp
Rotations
Easing functions
Dot product
Cross Product
Quaternions
Geometry

Importantly need to be able to solve equations like "I want this to arrive in n seconds, how do I do that" or "it moves this fast, what time will it arrive"
  Basic algebraic equations like that
