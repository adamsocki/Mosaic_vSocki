To compile this program you need Visual Studio and the C++ development tools installed.

To compile this program goto your Windows Search Bar and type
"x64 Native Tools Command"

Navigate to this project directory using the "cd" command. The cd command works like this:
"cd path_of_directory_i_want_to_go_to"
You can go back a directory like this
"cd ..\"
And you can go to the c:\ drive like this
"cd c:\"

So for instance if you download the game engine and put it in your c:\ drive you could go to it like

"cd c:\mosaic"

You might have put it in your downloads in which case you'd try

cd "c:\Users\my_name\Downloads"

Once you are in this directory type "win_compile.bat" (you can use TAB for auto-completion)

Once it has compiled you should see a new directory called "build" with a "game.exe" inside.

To run it from your command prompt you can type "build\game.exe"



If the game runs very slowly you may not be using your graphics card. Right click the "game.exe" and select "run with graphics processor" and choose the graphics card instead of the "integrated graphics" which is sometimes the default on laptops.


If you're using the Mosaic features then look in src/mosaic.cpp. See at the top there is a list of #defines. You can toggle those between 1 and 0 to compile certain example games. Make sure everything is set to 0 except for the game you want to compile.

If you want to make your own game, simply set all of them to 0, and include your own file that has a

MyMosaicInit() function and a MyMosaicUpdate() function (see src/examples/mosaic_clean.cpp for an example of these).
