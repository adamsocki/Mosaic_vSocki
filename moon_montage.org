Pelting moon with craters

Setting orbit so part of moon always faces away

Photo of the earth

Closeup shot of side of moon approaching camera

Mission control stuff

My original moon dream 

Constant companion

How the light of the moon is the next days light

Waves

Drawing the moon (maybe as grid sizes change)

Moon split from earth. Drag mouse in an arc to fling a meteror to crack off the moon. 

That gigantic vehicle on treads in the Apollo 11 trailer. Star Wars

Waves covering and revealing moonlight. 

Fill a crescent moon with liquid

Paint the moon blood red

The half moon at a slight decline is neat; it's big and dark wheat-colored, could roll something off of it? Looked like a boat. 


* MISC
Give player control of pacing and editing of the montage, but I don't see how that's doable. Maybe just make it an interactive montage
